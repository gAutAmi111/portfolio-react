                I'm a passionate full-stack web developer with a focus on building responsive, user-friendly web applications. I enjoy turning ideas into scalable digital solutions using modern technologies like React, Python, Django and MySql. With hands-on experience developing projects like a Flipkart Clone, I have a strong foundation in both frontend and backend development, API integration, and deploying real-world applications. I'm always eager to learn new tools, solve challenging problems, and contribute to meaningful projects.
